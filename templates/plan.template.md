# Task

Describe the task you want to accomplish here.

## Completion Criteria

<!--
STRUCTURE RULES:
- Number criteria starting from 0: `- [ ] 0. Description`
- Use ### subheadings to organize sections (NOT ##)
- All criteria must be under ## Completion Criteria
- ## Context and ## Backlog go at the END, after all criteria

CRITERIA RULES:
- Make criteria objectively verifiable
- One specific, atomic task per criterion
- Include test criteria: "All tests pass: <command>"
- Include quality criteria: "Run lint/typecheck with no errors"

FOR AI AGENTS POPULATING THIS FILE:
- ALWAYS check existing criteria before adding new ones
- NEVER add duplicate tasks - search for similar wording/intent
- Number new tasks sequentially from the highest existing number + 1
- Group related tasks under ### subheadings by feature/priority
- Mark priority in heading: (P0 - Critical), (P1 - High), (P2 - Medium)
- Keep iterating: scan codebase, find gaps, add tasks, repeat
- Reference specific files and line numbers when possible
-->

### Initial Tasks
- [ ] 0. First criterion
- [ ] 1. Second criterion
- [ ] 2. All tests pass

## Implementation Plan

Optional: Outline the steps to complete this task:

- [ ] Step 1: Description
- [ ] Step 2: Description
- [ ] Step 3: Description

## Context

Add any relevant context, constraints, or guidance:

- Important files: `src/...`
- Avoid: ...
- Prefer: ...

## Backlog

<!--
Add blocked/future items here. Format:
  - [ ] BLOCKED: Feature name (needs: what's missing)
  - [ ] FUTURE: Feature name (reason for delay)
  - [ ] NEEDS_INPUT: Feature name (need: what input from user)

These are shown to Claude but NOT worked on.
Move to Completion Criteria when ready to implement.
